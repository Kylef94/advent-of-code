A repository containing my Advent of code solutions, I previously had a repo for my 2023 solutions but wanted to have a single repo for each year I attempt problems from, I would also like to try problems in different languages and prefer to keep everything in one place

As a policy I do not use AI to attempt such questions as I think it hinders learning, which is a key goal of Advent of Code.
